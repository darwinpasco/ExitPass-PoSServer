## 2. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the approved v1.0 API contract baseline for the ExitPass Site-level POS Server. It translates the approved POS/Invoicing BRD and approved POS Server System Design into API ownership, route families, request/response semantics, status behavior, idempotency behavior, authentication/authorization expectations, error model, and integration responsibilities.

This contract covers API planning and contract semantics for:

- Central PMS to POS Server fiscal issuance.
- Sales Invoice issuance, status, lookup, print/digital consistency, and digital SI URL return.
- Digital SI URL access and channel/terminal QR presentation from the POS Server-returned URL.
- Channel and terminal registration/status.
- Fiscal identity configuration.
- Reprints and repeated digital access.
- Void/refund/cancel/return fiscal adjustments.
- X-read, Z-read, BIR Sales Summary, Annex E, EJ, POSLog, and fiscal exports.
- Fiscal reset, recovery continuity check, supervised recovery, exception/retry status, and audit/event impact.
- WebPay, APM, Cashier POS, EC Device / Continuity Terminal, operator-assisted payment, and future channel integration responsibilities.

This document does not define final database tables, columns, indexes, constraints, migrations, final DTO schemas, final event schemas, final status-code enum storage, or implementation internals.

Route names and endpoint candidates in this document are provisional until API contract review.

## 3. Reference Baseline

| Reference | Role in this contract |
| --- | --- |
| `ExitPass_POS_Invoicing_BRD_v1.0.md` | Approved business requirements and authority model. |
| `ExitPass_POS_Server_System_Design_v1.0.md` | Approved technical design and API impact baseline. |
| POS Server API Contract planning artifacts | Source analysis, decision log, outline, open questions, and impact map. |
| POS Server System Design technical and approval-readiness reviews | Confirms design readiness and non-blocking cleanup closure. |
| ExitPass API Contract Pack v1.2 | Supporting baseline for platform authority and integration conventions. |
| ExitPass BRD/System Design/Database/Engineering Pack v1.2 | Supporting baseline for Central PMS, payment, session, site, vendor, and ExitAuthorization authority. |
| RMO No. 24-2023 and Annex D/E/F/G references | Supporting fiscal reporting, X/Z, BIR Sales Summary, sales books, evaluation, and accreditation inputs. |
| Hikvision APM gap analysis and developer checklist | Supporting APM print/presentation, POSLog/EJ/export, and terminal behavior inputs. |
| BIR RMO No. 10-2019 | Supporting Diplomat VAT Privilege / VAT Exemption inputs. |

## 4. API Ownership and Authority Model

The API contract shall preserve the approved authority model.

| Authority area | Owner | API rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Payment finality | Central PMS | POS Server APIs consume verified payment finality context from Central PMS but do not declare platform payment finality. |
| ExitAuthorization | Central PMS | POS Server APIs must not issue, approve, create, mutate, or bypass ExitAuthorization. |
| Fiscal issuance | Site POS Server | POS Server owns Sales Invoice issuance and fiscal document lifecycle for the resolved Site. |
| Fiscal document numbering | Site POS Server | POS Server owns SI and adjustment numbering according to confirmed policy. |
| Digital SI URL | Site POS Server | POS Server returns digital SI URL where digital delivery is enabled. |
| Channel/terminal presentation | Channel/terminal under Site POS Server | Channels/terminals may display or print SI, present the digital SI URL, or convert the POS Server-returned URL into a QR code where supported without becoming fiscal issuer. |
| Refund/reversal money movement | Central PMS/payment provider | POS Server owns related fiscal adjustment documents, not money movement finality. |
| Gate/exit execution | Central PMS authorization chain | Gate/exit execution must not bypass Central PMS authorization. |

Payment Orchestrator and WebPay must not declare platform payment finality. Vendor PMS / HikCentral acknowledgment remains synchronization only and is not payment finality or exit authority.

## 5. API Consumers and Trust Boundaries

| Consumer / boundary | Contract posture |
| --- | --- |
| Central PMS | Primary trusted internal caller for payment-linked SI issuance, fiscal reference recording, exception status, and controlled fiscal workflow coordination. |
| WebPay | Channel-facing consumer of digital SI presentation/status through approved Central PMS/POS Server flow; not finality authority. |
| APM | Terminal/channel that may present or print POS Server-issued SI and generate/display/print QR from the digital SI URL where supported; not fiscal authority. |
| Cashier POS | Terminal/channel that may support SI presentation, reprint, adjustment, and cashier/session context under authorization. |
| EC Device / Continuity Terminal | Continuity terminal/channel under Site POS Server authority; offline fiscal issuance remains restricted unless approved. |
| Operator-assisted terminal/workflow | Assisted payment flow that may present SI, digital SI URL, channel-side QR, and exception status; operator cannot declare platform finality. |
| Future channels | Must register as child channels/terminals and follow the same fiscal authority pattern. |
| Fiscal administrators | Privileged internal actors for fiscal identity, export, reset, recovery, and configuration workflows. |
| Compliance auditors | Read/export/audit consumers according to RBAC and retention policy. |
| Customer digital SI URL access | Separate public/customer access boundary, open for Security/Privacy Review and final API design. |

Internal APIs and public/customer digital SI access must be treated as separate trust boundaries.

## 6. Common Contract Rules

All route families shall follow these common contract rules unless a later approved exception is documented.

## 29. Status Model

This section defines proposed status taxonomy at planning-contract level. Final status values remain pending API Contract review and future Database Design alignment.

| Status concept | Intended use |
| --- | --- |
| Fiscal issuance requested | Issuance request accepted or recorded. |
| Issued | Fiscal document successfully issued. |
| Failed | Operation failed and requires handling. |
| Timed out | Caller did not receive a completion response within the expected window. This is not successful issuance. |
| Completion unknown | Caller cannot safely determine whether issuance completed and must query status before retrying or authorizing exit. This is not successful issuance. |
| Retry pending | Controlled retry is queued or expected. |
| Pending recovery | Operation blocked by recovery/continuity state. |
| Blocked | Operation cannot proceed due to policy, configuration, authorization, or fiscal state. |
| Cancelled | Request cancelled according to allowed workflow. |
| Duplicate / idempotent replay | Duplicate request recognized under idempotency model. |
| Reprint requested | Reprint request accepted or recorded. |
| Reprint completed | Reprint completed and audited. |
| Reprint failed | Reprint request failed or was blocked and requires handling. |
| Adjustment requested | Adjustment request accepted or recorded. |
| Adjustment issued | Adjustment fiscal document issued. |
| Adjustment rejected | Adjustment request rejected. |
| Report requested | Report generation requested. |
| Report generated | Report generated successfully. |
| Report failed | Report generation failed. |
| Export requested | Export requested. |
| Export generated | Export generated successfully. |
| Export failed | Export generation failed. |
| Export validation pending | Structured export validation is queued or in progress. |
| Export validation passed | Structured export validation passed against the approved validation profile. |
| Export validation failed | Structured export validation failed and requires operational/support handling. |
| Reset requested | Fiscal reset requested. |
| Reset approved | Fiscal reset approved. |
| Reset completed | Fiscal reset completed. |
| Reset rejected | Fiscal reset rejected. |
| Recovery check passed | Fiscal continuity check passed. |
| Recovery check failed | Fiscal continuity check failed. |
| Digital SI URL active | Digital SI URL is currently accessible according to policy. |
| Digital SI URL expired | Digital SI URL has expired according to policy. |
| Digital SI URL revoked | Digital SI URL has been revoked or blocked according to policy. |
| POS Server online | POS Server is reachable/healthy according to approved operational status rules. |
| POS Server offline | POS Server is unreachable/unhealthy according to approved operational status rules. This does not approve offline fiscal issuance. |
| Channel/terminal online | Channel or terminal is reachable/healthy according to approved operational status rules. |
| Channel/terminal offline | Channel or terminal is unreachable/unhealthy according to approved operational status rules. This does not approve offline fiscal issuance. |

Timeout and completion-unknown states must not be treated as successful fiscal issuance. Central PMS shall not issue ExitAuthorization based only on timed-out or completion-unknown status. Idempotent status lookup and retry semantics must prevent duplicate Sales Invoice issuance.

## 31. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API contract grants ExitAuthorization authority to POS Server | Core authority violation. | Keep ExitAuthorization outside all POS Server route families. |
| POS Server API declares payment finality | Central PMS authority violation. | Treat payment finality as Central PMS context only. |
| Weak idempotency | Duplicate SI or inconsistent fiscal reference. | Require `Idempotency-Key` for side-effecting operations and define retry semantics. |
| Sequence gaps handled incorrectly | BIR/accreditation or audit failure. | Keep sequence-gap behavior open for BIR/accounting and API review. |
| Digital SI URL overexposes data | Privacy/security breach. | Keep public/customer access model separate and subject to Security/Privacy Review. |
| QR presentation becomes APM-only | Future channels diverge from platform model. | Treat QR as channel/terminal capability. |
| APM printing model conflicts with Site POS Server authority | Split fiscal authority or failed certification. | Keep POS Server as issuer and resolve APM print behavior with BIR/vendor confirmation. |
| Offline issuance is implied by continuity APIs | Duplicate/skipped fiscal sequences. | Keep offline issuance disabled/restricted until approved. |
| Adjustment API owns refund finality | Payment authority confusion. | Keep Central PMS/provider as refund/reversal finality authority. |
| Database details leak into API contract too early | Overcoupled design. | Define contract semantics without tables/columns/migrations. |
| Export format is finalized prematurely | Compliance mismatch. | Keep export formats open until BIR/accounting confirmation. |
